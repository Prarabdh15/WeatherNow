Additional Information / Notes

1. API Rate Limitations
The OpenWeather API free tier allows up to 60 API calls per minute.
If the app stops working or fails to fetch data, it may be due to exceeding the rate limit. Consider upgrading your API plan for higher limits if needed.

2. Error Handling
City Not Found: If the entered city name is invalid or unavailable in the OpenWeather database, an error message will be displayed.
Network Issues: Ensure your internet connection is stable, as the app relies on fetching data from an external API.

3. Units of Measurement
By default, the app displays temperature in Celsius using the units=metric parameter in the API request.
To display temperature in Fahrenheit, you can change the parameter to units=imperial in the API URL:
javascript

const apiURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=imperial`;

4. Icon Display
Weather icons are dynamically updated based on the icon field in the API response. These icons provide a visual representation of the weather conditions.

5. Deployment Notes
Ensure you set up environment variables for your API key in a real-world deployment to prevent unauthorized use. For local testing, the API key can remain hardcoded.
The app is tested and works well in modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

6. Compatibility
The app is designed to be responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
CSS styles are tested in major browsers. Minor inconsistencies may appear on older browsers.

7. Future Improvements
Search Suggestions: Add an autocomplete dropdown for city names.
Geolocation: Use the user's current location to fetch weather data automatically.
Error Logging: Log errors to a monitoring tool for better debugging in production environments.
